# TriviaGame

In this trivia game, users will have 30 seconds to answer 8 multiple choice questions. At the end of the 30 seconds, the user will be notified how many answers they got correct, incorrect, and how many questions were left unanswered.

To accomplish this, I used:

-Radios to make the questions multiple choice.
-J-Queries and functions in my javascript file to read through the user's selections and print the results on the screen.
-Media-queries to make the game responsive.
